## 🧠 How It Works

- Tasks are stored as objects in an array, and saved to `localStorage`.
- When the page loads, it checks for any existing tasks and renders them.
- Each task supports:
  - ✅ Checkbox to toggle completion
  - ✏️ Click-to-edit functionality
  - 🗑️ Delete all tasks button
- Styling is handled with custom CSS, including scrollbars and responsive design.
