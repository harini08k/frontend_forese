## Project Structure

```

todo_app/todo
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── style.css           # Styling and layout
├── script.js           # JS logic for the app

````

## How It Works

- Tasks are stored as objects in an array, and saved to `localStorage`.
- When the page loads, it checks for any existing tasks and renders them.
- Each task supports:
  - Checkbox to toggle completion
  - Click-to-edit functionality
  - Delete all tasks button
- Styling is handled with custom CSS, including scrollbars and responsive design.
